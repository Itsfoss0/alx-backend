## About
I18N (Internationalization) and L10N (Localization) are two important concepts in software development that deal with making software accessible and adaptable for users from different countries, languages, and cultural background.

_Internationalization (I18N)_:

Internationalization refers to the process of designing and developing software in a way that makes it easy to adapt and support multiple languages, regions, and cultures without requiring code changes. The goal of internationalization is to create a foundation that allows the software to be easily localized for different target audiences.
