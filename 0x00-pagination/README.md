## About
Pagination in APIs refers to the process of breaking down a large set of data into smaller, more manageable chunks (pages) that can be returned to clients one at a time. This approach is commonly used in APIs that retrieve large amounts of data to improve performance, reduce bandwidth usage, and provide a better user experience. Pagination allows clients to request and display data incrementally, rather than receiving the entire dataset in a single response.
